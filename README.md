<H1> Pathfinding for the Win - Project </h1>
Welcome, this is the final project for COP3530. 

<h2> About </h2>

Pathfinding is a very important component for video games. It enables characters to traverse the 3D world and navigate the environment efficiently. The challenge of pathfinding is to create the fastest and most optimal route between two points in a real time environment. This problem can get very complex the more complex the environment. There are different pathfinding methods that can be used to achieve this result. Each method has strengths and weaknesses between performance, size, and accuracy. 

<h2> Tools </h2>

Software: Unity Game Engine for graphical representation
Programming Languages: C#
HTML, CSS, Javascript or PHP for basic website presentation

<h2> How to run </h2>

<h2> How to play </h2>

Click + Drag to Move 
Scroll to Zoom 
Right + Drag to Rotate
Blue boxes are obstacles 
Green boxes are start / end points
Click boxes to select them and click again to move them
After selecting box, +/- to change size

Select Settings
Grid, Random, Terrain
Different algorithms
Terrain size
User picks start/end or NPC
Visualize the speed of the algorithms - Instant or Slow to fast
Visualize everything or path only

***Be careful selecting the highest settings with the highest graphical settings. The game will run poorly if you select to show all. Runs best using only "Path Only"

Alter settings then click run to run with selected settings.

Click reports to see all reports and compare settings

In the reports panel you can compare and contrast different algorithms. You can see the time it takes to run, the path length, the nodes visited count. When you use NPCs the report will update and show the average of all the paths requested with the settings.
