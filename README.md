<H1> Pathfinding for the Win - Project </h1>
Welcome, this is the final project for COP3530. 

<h2> About </h2>

Pathfinding is a very important component for video games. It enables characters to traverse the 3D world and navigate the environment efficiently. The challenge of pathfinding is to create the fastest and most optimal route between two points in a real time environment. This problem can get very complex the more complex the environment. There are different pathfinding methods that can be used to achieve this result. Each method has strengths and weaknesses between performance, size, and accuracy.
